		<h1> Project Lucifer </h1>
		<h2>Entry #1</h2>
		<p>It has been a while since the we left Earth and the old world behind.
		Apparently this settlement, called Project Janus, is an effort
		to escape from the political quandry that limited scientific
		growth in the old world. This settlement is pretty much
		egalitarian and made up almost entirely of scientists, engineers
		and technicians. I like this enviroment, I call it "mega-academia"
		and like many here, believe that this system should be used on
		a larger extent.</p>
		<p>My job here as a scientist is dark-energy research. I hope it would
		shed new light on the origin of the universe as well as some potential
		energy resources. I'll keep this log as a type of personal reflection
		and documentation on the achievement and/or failures of the project.
		Whether this project succeeds or fails is beyond my control, but
		I do hope this log may be some help to me or later generations.</p>
		<p>Today is the beginning of my project. I've been meaning
		to get this project going for a while now. Just this morning,
		our director, the ever egnimatic Mr. Isaak Frolov came
		up to me and told me the board of directors approved my request
		for dark matter research based on our current planet (Tau Ceti e).
		I personally have great respect for Mr. Frolov, about twleve years
		ago he invented HEAT (High Efficiency Antimatter Transport) which
		enabled long-distance space travel. With the aid of his invention, he 
		found Tau Ceti Epsilon. It was quite a surprise since the planet's
		existance was almost too good to be true. An oxygen-nitrogen
		atmosphere, surfrace temperature slightly lower than that of earth, 
		liquid water abundant on the surface. It's a paradise really.
		In 2025, he launched a secret search for young, brilliant scientists
		who absolutely despised politics on Earth and transported us to the
		planet. It has been our home ever since.</p>
		<p>I digress, regardless, this morning when I was eating breakfast
		in the staff cafeteria I saw him approaching me with a smile.</p>
		<p>"Mr. Pan!" he said, sounding joyful, "I've got good news for
		you"</p>
		<p>"Good morning Mr. Director, please call me Francis." It's always
		been weird to be addressed as a "Mr." by someone double your age, "I
		am excited to hear the news!"</p>
		<p>"How do you like to head your own research project?" The director
		said with a smile.</p>
		<p>I almost could not believe my ears, I was absolutely thunderstruck.
		For four years I've been in the facility, I've worked only as 
		assistants. And I'm not complaining, these people are in fact a lot
		smarter than I am. But now, I have the possiblity of becoming one
		of them, I'll head my own project!</p>
		<p>"So? What do you think?" The director asked, sounding impatient.</p>
		<p>"Sir, it would be my pleasure!" I said eagerly, I've been working
		on that dark energy thesis for a while now, seeing it put into a real
		project was my greatest reward.</p>
		<p>"That's the spirit!" said the director, "It'll be called Project
		Lucifer, may you bring light onto the unknown. Starting tomorrow
		You'll be working in room 307 and giving me monthly progress
		reports!"</p>
		<p>"Thank you Mr. Director." I said sincerely.</p>
		<p>"Alright, get to work." Said the director as he walked away into
		the distance.</p>


		<h2>Entry #2</h2>
		<p>I am extremely excited about whatever my plan of harvesting and
		detecting dark energy. This energy makes up for the missing chucks of
		the universe but nobody has ever conclusively proved its existance or
		used it in any manner. It was first theorized by A. Einstein as a way
		of explaining why the universe wasn't collapsing onto itself due to
		gravitational pulls from planets and systems. Later works by E. Hubble
		further proved that there must be something driving the galaxies apart
		as that more distant galaxies are moving away from each other with ever
		increasing speeds. This energy is now called "dark energy." It is calculated
		that dark energy consists as many as 74% of the observable universe
		but nobody has ever directly harnests it.</p>
		<p>It is almost without a doubt that dark energy exists in the macro world,
		since the creation of void between large superclusters despite their masses
		can hardly be a random event. However, harnesting dark energy requires
		controllable release of said energy at a manipulable level, and that's
		percisely what this project will do. It will study sci
