		<h1> Project Kronos - Ephraim Perez</h1>
		<h2>Entry #1</h2>
		<p>The endochronistic properties of thiotimoline have been predicted since the early 1950's, but research was never granted towards the subject. I happened to come across several papers written by the renowed Professor Asimov, whose early private research on thiotimoline was regarded by the scientific community as pure fiction; in his findings, 1 g of thiotimoline dissolves 1.12 seconds <i>before</i> 10 mL of water is added to it. Asimov's sample was gathered from a miniscule sample of <i>Rosacea karlsbadensis rugo</i> brush, which, due to its extremely localized habitat of what is now the Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique, went extinct roughly 37 million years ago, was extremely costly and difficult to acquire. However, due to the recent success of Project Osiris, I have ordered a large quantity of <i>Rosacea</i> plants for my research.</p>
		<p>I recently recieved the green light from Director Frolov and the approval committee; I am due to begin my lab work within the coming week.</p>
